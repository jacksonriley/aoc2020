Advent of Code 2020
===================

My solutions for [Advent of Code 2020](https://adventofcode.com/2020).

Planning to do this year in Rust, we'll see if I run out of steam!

Input for each day goes in `input/<day>`.

The binary for each day can be run with `cargo run --bin <day>`.
This will output the solutions for part 1 and part 2.

Unit tests can be run with `cargo test --bin <day>`.
